Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:\\n1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)\\n2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks\\n3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app\\nSee https://react.dev/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.\"\n        );\n      return dispatcher;\n    }\n    function releaseAsyncTransition() {\n      ReactSharedInternals.asyncTransitions--;\n    }\n    function startTransition(scope) {\n      var prevTransition = ReactSharedInternals.T,\n        currentTransition = {};\n      currentTransition.types =\n        null !== prevTransition ? prevTransition.types : null;\n      currentTransition._updatedFibers = new Set();\n      ReactSharedInternals.T = currentTransition;\n      try {\n        var returnValue = scope(),\n          onStartTransitionFinish = ReactSharedInternals.S;\n        null !== onStartTransitionFinish &&\n          onStartTransitionFinish(currentTransition, returnValue);\n        \"object\" === typeof returnValue &&\n          null !== returnValue &&\n          \"function\" === typeof returnValue.then &&\n          (ReactSharedInternals.asyncTransitions++,\n          returnValue.then(releaseAsyncTransition, releaseAsyncTransition),\n          returnValue.then(noop, reportGlobalError));\n      } catch (error) {\n        reportGlobalError(error);\n      } finally {\n        null === prevTransition &&\n          currentTransition._updatedFibers &&\n          ((scope = currentTransition._updatedFibers.size),\n          currentTransition._updatedFibers.clear(),\n          10 < scope &&\n            console.warn(\n              \"Detected a large number of updates inside startTransition.

To illustrate, if you were to use this data type to store\n * HTTP responses, the keypath would include the URL and everything listed by\n * the Vary header.\n * \n * See vary-path.ts for more details.\n *\n * The order of elements in a keypath must be consistent between lookups to\n * be considered the same, but besides that, the order of the keys is not\n * semantically meaningful.\n *\n * Keypaths may include a special kind of key called Fallback. When an entry is\n * stored with Fallback as part of its keypath, it means that the entry does not\n * vary by that key. When querying the cache, if an exact match is not found for\n * a keypath, the cache will check for a Fallback match instead. Each element of\n * the keypath may have a Fallback, so retrieval is an O(n ^ 2) operation, but\n * it's expected that keypaths are relatively short.\n *\n * Example:\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1], PRODUCT_PAGE_1);\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', Fallback], GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE);\n *\n *   // Exact match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1]) -> PRODUCT_PAGE_1\n *\n *   // Fallback match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 2]) -> GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE\n *\n * Because we have the Fallback mechanism, we can impose a constraint that\n * regular JS maps do not have: a value cannot be stored at multiple keypaths\n * simultaneously. These cases should be expressed with Fallback keys instead.\n *\n * Additionally, because values only exist at a single keypath at a time, we\n * can optimize successive lookups by caching the internal map entry on the\n * value itself, using the `ref` field. This is especially useful because it\n * lets us skip the O(n ^ 2) lookup that occurs when Fallback entries\n * are present.\n *\n\n * How to decide if stuff belongs in here, or in cache.ts?\n * -------------------------------------------------------\n * \n * Anything to do with retrival, lifetimes, or eviction needs to go in this\n * module because it affects the fallback algorithm. For example, when\n * performing a lookup, if an entry is stale, it needs to be treated as\n * semantically equivalent to if the entry was not present at all.\n * \n * If there's logic that's not related to the fallback algorithm, though, we\n * should prefer to put it in cache.ts.\n */\n\n// The protocol that values must implement.

This is a stronger form of dynamic\n * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside\n * unstable_cache should error.

scheduled back to back will run\non the same iteration of the event loop:\n\n```ts\nsetTimeout(one, 0)\nsetTimeout(two, 0)\n```\n\nInternally, each timer is assigned a `_idleStart` property that holds\nan internal libuv timestamp in millisecond resolution.\nThis will be used to determine if the timer is already \"expired\" and should be executed.\nHowever, even in sync code, it's possible for two timers to get different `_idleStart` values.\nThis can cause one of the timers to be executed, and the other to be delayed until the next timer phase.\n\nThe delaying happens [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/c208ffc66bb9418ff026c4e3fa82e5b4387bd147/lib/internal/timers.js#L556-L564).\nand can be debugged by running node with `NODE_DEBUG=timer`.\n\nThe easiest way to observe it is to run this program in a loop until it exits with status 1:\n\n```\n// test.js\n\nlet immediateRan = false\nconst t1 = setTimeout(() => {\n  console.log('timeout 1')\n  setImmediate(() => {\n    console.log('immediate 1')\n    immediateRan = true\n  })\n})\n\nconst t2 = setTimeout(() => {\n  console.log('timeout 2')\n  if (immediateRan) {\n    console.log('immediate ran before the second timeout!')\n    console.log(\n      `t1._idleStart: ${t1._idleStart}, t2_idleStart: ${t2._idleStart}`\n    );\n    process.exit(1)\n  }\n})\n```\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\ni=1;\nwhile true; do\n  output=\"$(NODE_DEBUG=timer node test.js 2>&1)\";\n  if [ \"$?\" -eq 1 ]; then\n    echo \"failed after $i iterations\";\n    echo \"$output\";\n    break;\n  fi;\n  i=$((i+1));\ndone\n```\n\nIf `t2` is deferred to the next iteration of the event loop,\nthen the immediate scheduled from inside `t1` will run first.\nWhen this occurs, `_idleStart` is reliably different between `t1` and `t2`.\n\n==========================\n| Solution               |\n==========================\n\nWe can guarantee that multiple timers (with the same delay, usually `0`)\nrun together without any delays by making sure that their `_idleStart`s are the same,\nbecause that's what's used to determine if a timer should be deferred or not.\nLuckily, this property is currently exposed to userland and mutable,\nso we can patch it.\n\nAnother related trick we could potentially apply is making\na timer immediately be considered expired by doing  `timer._idleStart -= 2`.\n(the value must be more than `1`, the delay that actually gets set for `setTimeout(cb, 0)`).\nThis makes node view this timer as \"a 1ms timer scheduled 2ms ago\",\nmeaning that it should definitely run in the next timer phase.\nHowever, I'm not confident we know all the side effects of doing this,\nso for now, simply ensuring coordination is enough.\n*/\n\nlet shouldAttemptPatching = true\n\nfunction
