     *   data from the server for the current segment. It uses the "url" property
     *   above to determine where to fetch from.
     *
     * - "inside-shared-layout" is used during a prefetch request to inform the
     *   server that even if the segment matches, it should be treated as if it's
     *   within the "new" part of a navigation — inside the shared layout. If
     *   the segment doesn't match, then it has no effect, since it would be

     *   A bit confusing, but that's because it has only one extremely narrow use
     *   case — during a non-PPR prefetch, the server uses it to find the first
     *   loading boundary beneath a shared layout.
     *
     *   TODO: We should rethink the protocol for dynamic requests. It might not
     *   make sense for the client to send a FlightRouterState, since this type is
