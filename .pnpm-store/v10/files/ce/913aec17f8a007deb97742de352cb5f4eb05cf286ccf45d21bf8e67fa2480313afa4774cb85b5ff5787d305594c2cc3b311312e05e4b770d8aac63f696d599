/**
 * This module provides a way to install SWC bindings without eagerly loading the entire swc/index module.
 *
 * The swc/index module can transitively load other modules (like webpack-config) that import React,
 * and React's entry point checks process.env.NODE_ENV at require time to decide whether to load
 * the development or production bundle. By deferring the require of swc/index until this function
 * is called, we ensure NODE_ENV is set before React is loaded.
